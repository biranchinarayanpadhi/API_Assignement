Assumptions:
------------------------------

1.All the bikes Work fine and nothing is Faulty.
2.The key "NbBikes" in the API represent the total number of bike Present in that particular bikepoint name i.e key as "commonName" and at that particular time key as "modified"
3.Here, i am not considering the how many bikes are docked and how many bikes are not docked or locked as i am assuming that the key "NbBikes" represent the number of Bike available.
